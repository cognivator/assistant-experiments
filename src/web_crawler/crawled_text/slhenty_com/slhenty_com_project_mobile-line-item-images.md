Line Item Images: Mobile-first design

design

### The Project

A legacy application supported attaching image-based evidence to a parent work
item, but did not support **associating images to specific 'line items.'** The
line items represent actions necessary to repair vehicle body damage, and the
image is typically a photo of the damaged portion of the vehicle.

### My Role

As **lead Interaction Designer** , I proposed, prototyped, and tested a method
for associating images (photos) to specific data records in the field using
mobile devices.

### Results

As part of an initiative to provide portions of the application on mobile
devices, the **image attachment workflow was re-imagined as a mobile-centric
activity** that supported line item associations.

### Notes

> #### Usage notes for Axure prototype
>
> Best viewed on a medium-sized mobile device in landscape orientation (e.g.
> iPhone 6), although not strictly required.
>
> Generally, the active hotspots and interactions are signaled by a cursor
> change, including the following (in rough order of appearance):
>
>   1. plus-sign placeholder (lower right)
>   2. Take Photo or Cancel buttons
>   3. photo button or Cancel buttons
>   4. Retake or Use buttons
>   5. the newly-attached photo (click)
>   6. the enlarged view (click)
>   7. the newly-attached photo (drag up to "correct" location on Left front
> fender)
