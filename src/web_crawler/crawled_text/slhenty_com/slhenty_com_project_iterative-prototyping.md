Iterative Prototyping: Estimate workflow integration

design

> Also see the related _[Exploratory Prototyping](exploratory-
> prototyping?a=true&n=99)_ project which evolved from iterative prototpying.

### The Project

Run a series of usability tests, **allowing changes to the prototype** as soon
as usability trends form. This was an experiment in what became known
internally as **"iterative prototyping"**. Distinct from classic A-B testing,
the tests were to be conducted serially with any necessary changes to the
prototype made **at any point across test participants**. The underlying
intent was to **hone the solution as quickly as possible** , acknowledging
that the test results would not be classically 'valid', but more in the spirit
of **Heuristic Evaluation and Guerilla Usability** , a la Neilsen Norman
Group.

### My Role

As the **primary designer and prototyper** for this project, I built the
initial prototype informed by the areas of interest we were likely to change.
**I monitored the tests as an observer** to see firsthand the difficulties
encountered by the participants, and **modified the prototype between
participants** as deemed necessary.

### Interesting Challenges

The primary challenge with this kind of rapid, iterative prototyping is
similar to that of the _Exploratory Prototyping_ project ([see
details](exploratory-prototyping?a=true&n=99)) -- namely, how to build the
prototype to respond well to the current usability script, but with enough
**flexibility to quickly alter the script, layout, and interactions in
response to usability results**.

### Results

The solution was the beginning of what would become the **Mediator pattern
implemented in Axure** that became a standard prototyping method.

### Notes

> #### Usage notes for Axure prototype
>
> The demo is in three parts, reflecting the changes the prototype went
> through during usability testing. The task is recording and reporting the
> status of a workflow process to external parties.
>
> Accept the default configuration on the opening screen. These parameters
> allowed testing of slight variations without major changes to the prototype.
>
> ##### Round 1
>
> Generally, the active hotspots and interaction is signaled with a cursor
> change, and include (in rough order of appearance):
>
>   1. Web Status and Preview tabs, and Expand / Collapse arrow
>   2. Web Status Overdue filter checkbox, Apply and Reset buttons
>   3. Every control on the Web Status tab - especially note the Notes
> character countdown, the persistent History, and the additional dialog when
> changing the Due Out date
>

>
> ##### Round 2
>
> Main changes from Round 1:
>
>   * Filter changed to include Web Status Due filter in Filter By dropdown
>

>
> ##### Round 3
>
> Main changes from Round 2:
>
>   * Default to Preview tab
>   * Left-aligned Preview and Web Status tabs
>   * "Saved filter view" tabs represented above filter bar, including Status
> Reporting
