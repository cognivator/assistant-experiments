Tablet UI for genomic imaging hardware

dev

### The Project

Implement a **Windows tablet UI** for controlling the Omega Lum C and Omega
Lum G imaging hardware. The tablet is integrated into the imaging hardware
cabinet, intended for use by **scientists and technicians** to obtain
**digital images of genomic samples**.

### My Role

**Lead UI Developer** responsible for **implementing evolving UI designs**.

### Interesting Challenges

The important challenge for this project was responding to the **evolving UI
specification.** As a freelance project, it was important to respond to and
deliver the changing spec while **protecting all parties from interminable
project scope creep**. I instituted **SCRUM agile methodology** for my portion
of the project with weekly backlog review with the stakeholders.

### Results

The project manager and UX designer quickly **appreciated the backlog
prioritization process** , and had the visibility they needed to manage the
cost of backlog changes.
