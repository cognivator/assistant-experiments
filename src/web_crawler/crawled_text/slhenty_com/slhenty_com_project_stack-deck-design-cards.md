"Stacking the Deck": Design principles communication plan

design

### The Project

The User Experience team codified a set of **Design Principles to guide design
behavior**. When the effort reached the attention of other business units, the
Principles were **adopted across the organization**.

Part of the company-wide rollout included producing **"marketing collateral"
to accompany introductory seminars** conducted by the UX team.

### My Role

**Conceived and promoted the idea** of portable, "collector card-style"
reminders of the design principles. Created the **initial paper prototypes** ,
oversaw the visual design, **arranged and specified the print run** , and
**sourced the packaging**.

### Interesting Challenges

The most difficult part of this project was **designing and obtaining
appropriate packaging** for the cards. The inspiration from the beginning was
a collector's card series **like packs of baseball cards** , but that
packaging proved to be difficult and expensive to design and source.

I ultimately discovered a **local source of baseball collector card sleeves**
that could be purchased in bulk quite cheaply.

### Results

The cards were printed and laminated like playing cards, and were distributed
in a plastic sleeve.
