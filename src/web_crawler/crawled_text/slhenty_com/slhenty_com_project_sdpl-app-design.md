San Diego Public Library: Scenic projector app

design

> Also see the related _[DEV](sdpl-scenic-projector?a=true&n=99)_ project
> covering the integration of the projector, kiosk, and back-office app.

### The Project

A free-standing kiosk, a scenic projector, and a back office computer
connected in an isolated network. The projector **displays a list of donor
names on an architectural pillar** , and the kiosk allows selection of a name
from the master list for temporary display of the associated signature of the
donor on the pillar. The back office computer provides donor names and
signature file upload to the kiosk, **selection of day- or night-time color
scheme for the projection** , and **real-time control of the projector
lamps**. The kiosk hosts all functions including web, web socket, data, and
scheduler services **using node-windows to run the node processes as Windows
services**.

### My Role

**Interaction Designer** and **Full-stack developer**. Designed all aspects of
inter-device communication, including the back office web application that
configures and controls the installation in real time.

### Results

The design was **approved and implemented** as an integral part of managing
the installation content and operation.

### Notes

> #### Usage Notes for Axure Prototype
>
> The clickable prototype allows several actions to be simulated, below.
>
> Generally, the active hotspots are signaled with a cursor change, and
> include (in rough order of appearance):
>
>   1. Switch the projector back and forth between Light and Dark modes
>   2. Upload individual signature files, or a complete set of signatures
>   3. Schedule changeovers between Light and Dark modes, usually to
> accommodate daytime vs nighttime lighting
>   4. Upload a presentation file for display on the projector
>   5. Switch the projector to show the current presentation
